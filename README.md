# Chatgpt_with_aiolearn
This project is a simple chatbot that uses the requests library to send user input to a server and print the server's response. The server's address is `http://5.161.91.18/chat

To use the chatbot, run the script and enter a question when prompted. The chatbot will then print the server's response.

Here is an example of how to use the chatbot:

Copy code
$ python chatgpt.py
سوال رو بپرس
What is the meaning of life?
{'answer': 'The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the purpose and significance of life or existence in general.'}
The chatbot is called "ChatGPT with Aiolearn" because it was created as a simple example for a workshop on asynchronous programming with the aiolearn library. However, this chatbot does not use aiolearn and can be used without it.

Dependencies
This project requires the requests library, which can be installed with pip:

Copy code
$ pip install requests
Usage
To use the chatbot, run the script and enter a question when prompted.
